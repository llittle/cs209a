As future data scientists, you will often be expected to work with others, and working in pairs can help practice communicating data science concepts.\n",

    "- Please use .head() when viewing data. Do not submit a notebook that is **excessively long**. \n",
    "- In questions that require code to answer, such as \"calculate the $R^2$\", do not just output the value from a cell. Write a `print()` function that includes a reference to the calculated value, **not hardcoded**. For example: \n",
